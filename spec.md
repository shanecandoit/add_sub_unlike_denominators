# Fraction Practice App Idea

I want a simple web app for my 5th-grade students to practice adding and subtracting fractions with different denominators.

**Target Audience:** 10-11 year olds.

**How it should work:**
1.  The app shows two random fractions (like 1/3 + 1/4).
2.  The students have to solve it in steps so they don't get overwhelmed.
3.  **Step 1:** They need to find the Least Common Denominator (LCD).
4.  **Step 2:** They convert the fractions to have that new denominator.
5.  **Step 3:** They add or subtract the top numbers (numerators).
6.  **Step 4:** If possible, they simplify the answer (though this might be hard, maybe just getting the final fraction is enough for now).

**Features:**
- Needs to look clean and simple.
- Big text so it's easy to read.
- If they get an answer wrong, the box shoud turn red or shake.
- If they get it right, it turns green and lets them go to the next step.
- No logins or complicated setup, just a file I can open in the browser.
